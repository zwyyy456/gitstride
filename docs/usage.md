# GitStride User Guide

[Back to README](../README.md)

### First Launch

New installations show a brief welcome window. Choose **Open GitHub Settings** to connect your account, or **Set Up Later** to continue without signing in. The welcome window does not appear again automatically; reopen it from **Help → Welcome to GitStride…** to review the introduction without resetting preferences or credentials. Existing account setups skip the automatic welcome.

Until you connect, the workspace and menu bar offer **Open GitHub Settings**. Pull request automation is an optional, separate connection in the same settings page.

### GitHub Connection

Open **Settings → GitHub → Account** to log in or disconnect. To change accounts or connection methods, disconnect first, then log in again. OAuth shows a device code: choose **Copy Code and Open GitHub**, paste it into Device activation, and approve access. You can close Settings while waiting; Cancel stops the login attempt.

The Release build can also use an existing GitHub CLI login. Switching connections clears the previous project cache and pending operations; complete or check any submitted work on GitHub before reconnecting. Background automation keeps its own connection.

### Menu Bar
Click the GitStride icon in your menu bar to see your projects. Select a project and browse issues by status.

### Search
Type in the search bar to filter issues by title or number. Use `@username` to filter by assignee.

### Quick Create
In the project window (Board or Table) or menu bar search field, type `>` followed by an issue title and press Return. GitStride opens the creation form with your input filled in. Confirm the repository and status, then choose **Create Issue**. Press Esc while typing to cancel quick-create input.

The new Issue form offers `Backlog` whenever the Project has a Status field. If you select it and the Project lacks that option, GitStride adds a gray `Backlog` option before creating the Issue. Other status options are left intact.

You can include Quick Entry qualifiers, for example `> Fix login repo:owner/repo status:Todo @me #bug`. Both `> Title` and `>Title` are accepted. Entering only `>` and pressing Return opens Quick Entry so you can finish the input there. Options that do not match the project stay in Quick Entry with a validation message.

### Project Layouts
Click "Open Board" or use the keyboard shortcut to open the project window. Switch between **Board** and **Table** in the toolbar; GitStride remembers the layout for each project locally.

In Board, drag issues between status columns. Table uses aligned issue IDs, spacious rows, and collapsible status groups. Click a title to open details, or use native row selection and the item context menu. Click a column header to sort; when grouped, sorting applies within each status group.

Use **Display Options** to switch between status grouping and an ungrouped table, choose visible fields, or restore **Project Order**. On macOS 14.4 and later, multiple project fields can be shown as independent resizable, sortable columns. macOS 14.0–14.3 supports one selected project field column. Layout, grouping, column settings, and sorting are remembered per project locally.

Search and item filters carry across layouts. In Board, status filters change the cards without hiding columns; visible columns remain available even when no items match. Use **Display Options → Board Columns** to choose which status columns appear, or **Show All Columns** to reveal them without changing item filters. Hidden board status columns do not filter the table. Both layouts support the existing item context menu and bulk selection actions; layout preferences do not change saved views on GitHub.

### Work Views and Delivery

Use the toolbar’s Filter button for status, assignee, type, and label conditions; More Conditions contains milestone, parent issue, and completion. Display Options separately controls board column visibility, grouping, sorting, and visible fields. The ellipsis menu manages views saved on this Mac. Open in GitHub, My Work, and multiple selection remain direct toolbar actions. The content area has no permanent view/filter bar. Active conditions appear only while filtering and can be removed individually; **Clear Filters** clears item filters and search while preserving display preferences, including hidden board columns. The item count shows how many project items match the filters and search, including matches in hidden board columns. Board Columns reports how many status columns are shown.

Saved Views → Save Current View keeps the current filters, Board/Table layout, table sorting and columns, card fields, and hidden board columns. Each saved view has independent display preferences. Filter edits are marked Modified until you choose Update Saved Filters; display preferences are remembered automatically. Search text is temporary. These preferences do not create or modify GitHub saved views.

For a defect view, choose the actual issue type or label your project uses, then save the view with a name such as Bugs. Filtering preserves the current layout and display preferences. Single-select fields use their configured option order when sorting.

Choose Delivery by Milestone or Delivery by Parent Issue to see completed and blocked counts, with All, Unfinished, and Blocked shortcuts. Counts cover only issues present in the current project, including hidden board columns, and ignore other active filters. A milestone remains repository-scoped; a parent can collect children from different repositories. Completion follows GitHub issue state, and blocked counts include only unfinished issues with unresolved dependencies.

Board cards emphasize a two-line title, repository and issue number, assignees, and selected project fields. Unresolved blockers remain visible. Display Options → Show Fields can add milestone, labels, engineering signals, and project fields using their GitHub names and identities. Both layouts keep Filter and Display Options together after the layout switcher.

Selecting an item in Board, Table, or My Work opens the detail page with Back navigation at every window width. You can also open the item in its own window.

Choose **Edit** in the detail toolbar (or **Workspace → Edit Item…**) to change the title and Markdown description, then **Save** (⌘ Return) or **Cancel**. The editing sheet can be resized for longer descriptions. Issue and PR edits update the original GitHub content in every project that references it; draft edits update the project draft. Editing becomes available after details load when you have permission to edit that content. Failed saves keep your input so you can retry.

### Pull Request Automation

Under **Automation service**, choose **Default service**, **Custom address**, or **Disabled**, then save and restart GitStride. A custom address must be an HTTPS origin without a path, query, fragment, or embedded credentials. The current service remains active until restart. Switching servers requires that server's own automation connection and does not stop processing on the previous server; pause or delete its connection first if needed.

Connect automation once from **Settings → GitHub → Pull Request Automation**. Every repository currently available to the GitHub App is included automatically, and closing Issues are updated in every matching personal Project. The selected Project supplies the Status mapping names used across Projects; In Progress and Done are required. For Ready pull requests, choose either `Move to In review` or `Keep in In progress`. The first choice reuses a case-insensitive `In review` match or adds an Orange `In review` only when a matching Project first needs it. The second never changes Project options. Automation never adds Backlog. The hosted Worker runs even when GitStride is closed, and a running app refreshes displayed Project data and Automation connection health when the Worker reports a change.

Automation waits 3 seconds before reading current PR states and updating linked Issue items. All linked closing PRs must be merged for Done; any open Draft keeps the Issue In Progress; otherwise an open Ready uses your review policy. We recommend disabling overlapping built-in Project Status workflows, but this is optional. The delay currently requires a Worker code change and deployment to adjust; it is not editable in GitStride.


The Worker temporarily processes GitHub Project Item responses to locate exact item identities. It does not persist or log private Issue content, and the desktop app stores its management token only in Keychain.

### Planning Model

GitStride keeps GitHub's native concepts separate:

- **Project** collects and presents work. Most projects can stay focused on one repository, while a project may still contain issues from several repositories.
- **Status** is the Project workflow state used by the board, such as Todo, In Progress, and Done. Avoid a second `Phase` field when it represents the same workflow.
- **Milestone** is a repository-scoped delivery target. GitStride loads milestones from the issue's repository and stores the selected milestone on the issue itself.
- **Parent/sub-issues and dependencies** express cross-repository delivery structure. Use a parent issue as the cross-repository delivery target, then attach sub-issues and blocking relationships from any repository.
- **Release** can remain an optional Project custom field when a lightweight grouping across repositories is useful. It is not synchronized with repository milestones.

Project field configuration remains managed on GitHub. If an existing `Phase` field duplicates `Status`, remove or repurpose it in the GitHub Project settings rather than maintaining two workflow fields.
